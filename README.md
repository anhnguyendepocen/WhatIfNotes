# WhatIfNotes
Notes from the reading group of *Causal Inference: What If*, by Hernan and Robins (version at 10nov2020)

Set up by Tim Morris, 23jan2020.

At the first book club, Kaat noted that the authors are still open to comments. So this repo was my suggested way of keeping track of out comments, which we could share with the authors when finished.

If you want to do this, feel free to keep notes in whatever format you like but:
1. If you are keeping notes in many documents (e.g. one per chapter), please create a directory including your name rather than putting them all in the main directory.
1. If you are using one document for notes on the whole book, include your name in the document name.

I have used markdown and the file is named TimNotes.md. If you want to to the same, look at my source code in a text editor or on GitHub.
